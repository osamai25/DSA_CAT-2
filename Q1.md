# Big O Notation Rules
1. **Coefficients are Ignored**  
   Example: O(5n) simplifies to O(n). The coefficient 5 is dropped.

2. **Lower Order Terms are Dropped**  
   Example: O(n³ + 10n² + 1) becomes O(n³). The dominant term (n³) remains.

3. **Different Inputs Use Different Variables**  
   Example: If two arrays of sizes `m` and `n` are processed separately, the complexity is O(m + n).

4. **Worst Case  Analysis**  
   Example: In linear search, the worst-case complexity is O(n) when the element is at the end.

5. **Non-Dominant Terms are Removed**  
   Example: O(n + log n) simplifies to O(n), as `n` grows faster than `log n`.
