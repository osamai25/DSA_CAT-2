# Arrays vs Linked Lists

**1. Memory Allocation**  
- **Arrays** require contiguous memory blocks. Size is fixed (static) or dynamically resized with overhead.  
- **Linked Lists** use non-contiguous memory. Nodes are dynamically allocated, allowing flexible growth.  

**2. Performance**  
- **Access Time**: Arrays allow O(1) access via index. Linked lists require O(n) traversal.  
- **Insertion/Deletion**:  
  - **Arrays**: Inserting/deleting at the end is O(1) (if space). Middle operations require shifting elements (O(n)).  
  - **Linked Lists**: Insert/delete at the beginning is O(1). End operations are O(n) without a tail pointer.  

**3. Use Cases**  
- Use arrays for frequent access and fixed size.  
- Use linked lists for frequent insertions/deletions at the beginning or dynamic sizing.
